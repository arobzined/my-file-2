    "#### This Project is actually about the concept of \"hate speech\", which we frequently encounter today and witness on social media. With the invention of the Internet, people all over the world can communicate. Although some people like the photos , videos and ideas we share , some people also criticize heavily . In this project, I will evaluate many positive or negative tweets shared on Twitter, a social media platform, and create a model through this evaluation. Although this is a project topic , I would like to remind you how easy it is to criticize people and break the hearts of people we do not know today . Before we criticize, we should consider how other people might feel. A better world is possible <3."

    "\n",
    "#### The term hate speech is understood as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that attacks or uses derogatory or discriminatory language against a person or group based on what they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, sex or another identity factor. In this problem, We will design a hate speech detection model with Machine Learning and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hate Speech Detection is generally a task of sentiment classification. So for training, a model that can classify hate speech from a certain piece of text can be achieved by training it on a data that is generally used to classify sentiments. So for the task of hate speech detection model, We will use the Twitter tweets to identify tweets containing  Hate speech."
